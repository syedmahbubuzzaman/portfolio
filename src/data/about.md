# Intro
I believe learning is a never-ending process and throughout our lives, we keep on developing ourselves. My enthusiasm for computers started when I was 7-8 years old, since then I always wanted to build a career based around computer and software. Now-a-days, I am immensely fascinated by Machine learning and Neural Networks. In my estimation, these technologies will be the pivotal for the next digital revolution.
